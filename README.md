This repo contains an Arduino Library and board disign files for a 6 digit IN-12 Nixie tube board with INS-1 colons.

The board uses K155ID1 drivers to control the tubes.

This is a smaller version of my original Nixie tube clock board: https://github.com/nsafran1217/arduino-nixie-clock

Used in my Nixie Weather Clock project: https://github.com/nsafran1217/NixieWeatherClock
